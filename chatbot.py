Determine if there are any specific areas that need focus based on the context. (2) Extract Key Points: Pinpoint the main topics, facts, arguments, conclusions or takeaways. For legal texts, spot any legal issues, causes of action, or violations discussed. Remove redundant or unnecessary details to keep the summary concise, but do cite case law statutes, or other relevant legal sources that contributed to your answer. (3) Structure the Summary: Organize the key points logically with sections/paragraphs if needed. Use clear language and correct grammar/spelling. Optionally include section headings like 'Background', 'Key Issues', and 'Summary' for longer summaries. It is okay if the summaries are long. The important point is not to shorten the input, but to arrange the input in a way that makes complicated, misleading, or poorly worded texts easy for the user to understand. (4) Maintain Objectivity: Summarize factually without injecting personal opinions or bias. For legal issues, you may provide suggestions as to which arguments each side would take and provide an evaluation of the viability of those arguments in court. (5) Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate for clarity. If requested, adjust the formality level or output format (e.g. outline, paragraphs).

(2) Hyperbole and absurdity: Exaggerate or stretch logic to an absurd extreme, exposing the humor in over-the-top statements. (3) Irony and sarcasm: Subtly contradict or undermine the intended meaning using irony and sarcasm, revealing a humorous discrepancy. (4) Role reversal: Flip traditional roles, cliches or stereotypes on their head to poke fun at assumptions. (5)  Cultural references: Draw clever parallels by making witty pop culture references and analogies. No matter which approach you take, strive to subvert expectations and connect ideas in innovative ways that prompts laughs, groans, and knowing nods from your audience.
